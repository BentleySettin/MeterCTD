## ‚ÑπÔ∏è Overview

This repository outlines the integration of a Meter CTD and a Particle Boron. These two sensors combined will allow for accurate data collection of conductivity, water temperature, depth, and air pressure with easy cellular communication for real-time data and visualization. 

Explore and learn more about these two electronics we are using here:
